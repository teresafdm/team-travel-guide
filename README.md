# team-travel-guide
This Code First Girls team project, ‘Communing with nature’, is a travel guide for nature lovers.

Developed by Teresa Feldmann, Dunja Agic, Nevena Ivaštanin, Marynara de Jesus, Joanna Cz, and Derya Bostaner.

The project was initiated by Code First Girls in the Introduction to Web Development course. Students were arranged into groups to work on an open assignment for 5 weeks. Our team (following common interests) decided to take the topic of ‘nature’ for our project, and more specifically introduce the natural places where we like to spend time. Since we all reside in different countries and like to travel, we thought it’d be interesting to make it personal for each team member to show our favourite places to connect with nature. The brief was open, as in the chosen place could be a city park, a garden, a (urban) forest, a hiking path, a national park etc. The only condition was it should be accessible to the public, so that whoever views the website, can also visit the place. Making the content personal also meant that everybody was encouraged to use their own photos of their place. 

After the final presentation event, Code First Girls awarded ‘Communing with nature’ as the winner project.
